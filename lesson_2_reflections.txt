What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git folder is created. You need to intialize to create a new repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It is an intermediate place which has the names of the files that are changed and that the user wants to commit. Not all
files in a repository will be changed with each commit. The staging area records the files that are changed with that commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can do a git diff --staged to see the difference between what is in the staging area as compared to the last commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
It is helpful to have a separate branch when you want to add an experimental feature or you want to use a new language for
your project.
