What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git folder is created. You need to intialize to create a new repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It is an intermediate place which has the names of the files that are changed and that the user wants to commit. Not all
files in a repository will be changed with each commit. The staging area records the files that are changed with that commit.
